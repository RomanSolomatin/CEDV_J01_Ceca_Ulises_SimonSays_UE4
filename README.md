# CEDV_J01_Ceca_Ulises
SIMON GAME (Minigame 1) made with Unreal Engine 4 for the CEDV (Videogames development expert course || Curso de experto en desarrollo de videojuegos) from the ESI from the UCLM made using only C++ and a bit of Blueprints

Exercise statement:

The minimum mandatory requirements to be met by the proposed development are described below:

- The game must have at least one presentation screen, a record screen, the game screen and a credit screen. Each screen will be a level in UE4.
- Integration of an HUD that displays the game score.
- The development has to be carried out in C++, being possible to use, optionally, Blueprints to undertake the following tasks:
  - Level loading.
  - Implementation of the presentation screen.
  - Implementation of the records screen. It is recommended to display a C++ function to be used from Blueprints to recover the records.
  - Implementation of the credit screen.
  - HUD interface design.

Optionally, it is possible to include any improvements over the minimum requirements outlined in the previous section, such as inclusion of music and sound effects, different difficulty levels, advanced HUD, etc. In these cases it is possible to use Blueprints or C++, although code-based solutions are preferred.
